- JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow
- NPM
- [Webpack - a module bundler](https://webpack.js.org/)

## What I learned

In this project, I practiced my front-end development skills by creating an interactive pricing component. I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the component, and I also learned how to use range input types and checkboxes to capture user input.

One of the main challenges I faced was calculating the total cost based on the user's selected options. I used arrays to store the possible page views and their corresponding costs, and then used JavaScript to update the total cost and page views based on the user's input.

Overall, this project helped me further develop my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and gave me a better understanding of how to create interactive components for websites.
